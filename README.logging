Both logging.basicConfig(level=numeric_level) and logger.setLevel(numeric_level) are used to set the logging level, but they serve different purposes and affect different parts of your logging setup. Here's a detailed comparison:
logging.basicConfig(level=numeric_level)

    Global Configuration:
        logging.basicConfig(level=numeric_level) is used to configure the root logger. It affects the default logging level and other configurations (like format and handlers) for the entire application unless overridden.
        It is typically called once at the start of your application. Any loggers that are created after this call and do not have their own level set will inherit this level.
        It can also configure other settings like the log format, output file, and more if specified in additional arguments.

    Applies To:
        All loggers that do not have a specific level set.
        It essentially sets a default level for all loggers in the application.

    Typical Use:
        When you want to set a global logging level for your entire application.
        When you want to set a logging level that will apply to all loggers unless explicitly overridden.

logger.setLevel(numeric_level)

    Specific Logger Configuration:
        logger.setLevel(numeric_level) sets the logging level for a specific logger instance. This level will override any level set by logging.basicConfig() for that particular logger.
        This method only affects the logger it is called on and not other loggers.

    Applies To:
        Only the specific logger instance on which it is called.
        Does not affect other loggers or the root logger unless it is called on the root logger itself.

    Typical Use:
        When you need more granular control over logging levels for different parts of your application.
        For example, if you have a module that you want to log at a DEBUG level while the rest of the application logs at INFO, you would use logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) for that module's logger.

Example to Illustrate the Difference:

python

import logging

# Set up basic global logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)

# Create a specific logger for a module
logger = logging.getLogger('my_module')

# Set a specific logging level for this logger
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Root logger (global settings)
logging.info("This will not be printed (global level is WARNING)")
logging.warning("This will be printed (global level is WARNING)")

# Specific logger
logger.debug("This will be printed (logger level is DEBUG)")
logger.info("This will not be printed (logger level is DEBUG, but this is INFO)")

Key Differences:

    Scope:
        logging.basicConfig(level=numeric_level) sets the logging level globally for all loggers that do not have a specific level set.
        logger.setLevel(numeric_level) sets the logging level for a specific logger only.

    Use Case:
        Use logging.basicConfig(level=numeric_level) when you want to set a default logging level for the entire application.
        Use logger.setLevel(numeric_level) when you need to customize the logging level for a particular module or component.

In practice, you might use both: logging.basicConfig() to set a global level and logger.setLevel() to override that level for specific loggers.
