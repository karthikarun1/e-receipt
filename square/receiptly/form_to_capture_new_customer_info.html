<!--
  After customer chooses receiptly as their option to get receipts, 
  square triggers /notify_payment endpoint in receiptly sending the
  payment_id and order_id. Receiptly in turn uses the payment_id to
  get the payment details, including card fingerprint. It then checks
  Is the card fingerprint is already found in its database?
      - No: Then receiptly sends a form to the square POS to capture 
        customer information (email or phone) - the form below is shown 
        to the customer. Once 
        the customer fills out this form and submits, it sends the info to
        receiptly backend. Receiptly then captures the customer info, the 
        fingerprint for the credit card number and creates a new customer profile
        (with unique customer_id) and stores it. Then it retrieves the details of
        the order and payment details and stores the order and payment details in
        its database along with the customer_id. Then it emails / SMS the receipt
        to the customer. Also it sends a push notification to the customer's account
        in the receiptly mobile app so that the customer gets the new notification
        and can view the receipt immediately. All these should happen in a fraction
        of seconds without latency. 

      - Yes: Then receiptly retrieves the order and payment details and stores them
        with the customer_id (located with the card fingerprint), emails / SMS the
        receipt to the customer and sends a push notification to the receiptly 
        mobile app.
