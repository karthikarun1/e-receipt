Me: I do see one use case where webhooks might be useful. In the case where a customer already opted for receiptly (previously with square with this credit card). In this case if receiptly gets notified of the payment along with the credit card fingerprint through webhooks, it can immediately identify that the customer opted for receiptly previously and automatically store that order / payment data and then automatically email / sms the receipt to the customer and also send a push notification to the receiptly app for the customer account.

Response:

You're absolutely right—this is a perfect use case for webhooks! If the customer has already opted for Receiptly in the past, you can use webhooks to automate the entire receipt process without needing the customer to re-select Receiptly every time they make a payment with the same credit card.
Webhooks for Returning Customers:

In this scenario, webhooks allow Receiptly to:

    Automatically identify the customer using the credit card fingerprint when the payment is processed.
    Automatically send the receipt to the customer via email or SMS, and potentially send a push notification to their Receiptly account.

Updated Workflow with Webhooks for Returning Customers:

    Customer Completes Payment:
        The customer makes a payment using the same credit card they used in a previous transaction where they selected Receiptly.

    Webhook Notifies Receiptly:
        Square sends a webhook to Receiptly with the payment ID, order ID, and the card fingerprint.

    Receiptly Identifies the Customer:
        Receiptly checks its database for the card fingerprint.
        If it finds that the customer has previously opted for Receiptly, it knows that the customer prefers receipts through Receiptly.

    Automatic Receipt Delivery:
        Receiptly automatically processes the payment, sends the receipt via email or SMS, and sends a push notification to the customer’s Receiptly app.

    No Need for Customer Input:
        The customer doesn’t need to interact with Receiptly again since the system automatically handles everything based on the credit card fingerprint.

Combining Both Approaches:

You can combine both the webhook and /notify_payment endpoint approaches for the best experience:

    New Customers:
        For first-time users, the customer selects Receiptly as the receipt option at the POS. This triggers the /notify_payment endpoint, and Receiptly prompts the customer to enter their email/phone.
    Returning Customers:
        For returning customers (based on card fingerprint), Receiptly gets notified via webhooks and automatically delivers the receipt without any further interaction.

Final Combined Workflow:

    Customer Completes Payment:
        If it’s a new customer, they manually select Receiptly at the POS (triggering the /notify_payment endpoint).
        If it’s a returning customer, Receiptly is automatically notified via webhooks.

    Receiptly Fetches Payment Details (using the payment ID from the webhook or /notify_payment call).

    Receiptly Identifies Customer (using the card fingerprint):
        If it’s a new customer, ask for email/phone.
        If it’s a returning customer, automatically send the receipt.
